# Ghost Coding challenge (Client)

### Introduction
- This is the client part of the coding challenge which mostly uses vanilla JS
  - But, the display of upvotes is rendered using React (by directly loading the minified react app bundle)
  - The above approach works well for small components or in this case for the challenge, but in production I would prefer writing JSX code which will be transpiled for the browser
